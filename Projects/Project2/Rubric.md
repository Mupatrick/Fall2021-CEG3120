    - Usage
        - with your changes to the code in place, describe
        - what commands you can type in your Discord server
        - what response this will provide (from your bot)
    - Research
        - you may have realized that it is lame that it only runs when you run the program.
        - In the real world, things are "always on", not waiting for Bob to turn his PC on and make sure the program is running.
        - Research some possible solutions that would solve this, and discuss why you think it would work.
